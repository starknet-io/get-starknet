# Wallet Standard

Get Starknet provides a Wallet Standard compatible implementation for Starknet.

## TL;DR

Access the currently connected wallet with the `useConnect` hook.

This (possibily undefined) value is a `WalletWithStarknetFeatures` object. This object exposes a list of accounts and the Starknet wallet API.

<Callout type="info">
    Applications should use the hooks provided by Starknet React to interact with the wallet. These hooks simplify working with the `WalletWithStarknetFeatures` object.
</Callout>

The Starknet wallet API is an object with the following properties:

 - `walletVersion`: the version of the wallet.
 - `request`: a function to send a request to the wallet using the wallet's RPC API.

```tsx [my-component.tsx]
import { useConnect, StarknetWalletApi } from "@starknet-io/get-starknet-ui";

export function MyComponent() {
  const { connected } = useConnect();

  if (!connected) {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Please connect your wallet</p>
      </div>
    )
  }

  const address = connected.accounts[0].address;
  const version = connected.features[StarknetWalletApi].walletVersion;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{address}</p>
      <p>{version}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
````

## API overview

Wallet Standard provides a generic "Web3 Wallet" API that supports multiple chains and wallets.

This wallet API has two properties:

 - `accounts`: an array of `WalletAccount` objects.
 - `features`: an object to expose the wallet's features. Features represent capabilities such as interacting with a specific chain, or emitting events.

The `WalletAccount` object provides the wallet's address together with additional (optional) properties such as the raw public key and the supported chains.

## Starknet Features

Get Starknet defines the Wallet Standard Starknet API (identifier: `starknet:walletApi`):

 - `walletVersion`: the version of the wallet.
 - `request`: a function to send a request to the wallet using the wallet's RPC API.

These two functions are used to interact with the wallet using the wallet's RPC API.
