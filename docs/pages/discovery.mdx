# Wallet Discovery

The `@get-starknet/discovery` package implements a store for Starknet Wallets that implements the [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard) discovery mechanism.

## Usage

```ts
import { createStore } from "@get-starknet/discovery";

const store = createStore();

// Get all registered wallets.
const wallets = store.getWallets();

// Subscribe to changes in the store.
// The callback will be called with the new list of wallets.
store.subscribe((wallets) => {
  // Do something with the wallets.
});
```

## For Wallet Developers

After you injected your wallet into the page, you should announce it to all Wallet Standard subscribers.
This is done by calling the `registerWallet` function from the `@wallet-standard/base` package.

This example assumes you are using the `StarknetInjectedWallet` adapter provided by Get Starknet.

```ts
import { registerWallet } from "@wallet-standard/base";

const wallet = new StarknetInjectedWallet(window.starknet_myWallet);

registerWallet(wallet);
```
